#Twitter sentiment analyses(Twitter Analyzer)s



This is an app which when given a particular tweeter handle, and a number, it will fetch all the tweet for that particular person together with the retweets on those tweets. This will work when the handle your query from has a public access e.g andela, nickiminaj, shakira, ntvkenya, emmanuelmuthui, citicentvkenya or you do follow that particular user.
